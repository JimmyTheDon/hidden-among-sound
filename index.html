      <p>
        Sound is a intangible and momentary form of communication. It is how we perceive mechanical vibration in our surrounding, but we are physically limited to a certain range of what we can perceive. This is a form of cryptographic communication that utilizes frequencies of sound within the upper limits of human hearing, sound frequencies that are hidden and masked by the sounds of our natural everyday environment. It goes unnoticed to all except by those who are the intended receivers. It can be overtly played in the open and covertly hidden within audio files and masked by music or any other form of noise.
